# Project 3: Recommendation System for Amazon Products

## ðŸŽ¯ My Objectives
* To share my work
* Receive feedback on improving methods
* Serve as reference material for anyone trying to learn how to use Machine Learning Models to create a recommendation system.

## ðŸ““ Project Description 
* **Objective** - To understand data and build a recommendation system for Amazon to use.
* **Problem Statement** - perform EDA on data, build recommendation systems using collaborative filtering and matrix factorization algorithms,tune the hyperparameters, and provide business recommendations.
* **Data Source** - Provided by Great Learning as materials for the project. [Can be found in repository]

## ðŸ““ Data Dictionary
* userId: Every user identified with a unique id
* productId: Every product identified with a unique id
* Rating: The rating of the corresponding product by the corresponding user
* timestamp: Time of the rating. We will not use this column to solve the current problem

## ðŸ““Key Features Used
* Libraries used - Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikitlearn, Surprise
* Software used - Python programming, Google Colab

## ðŸ““ Techniques used
* **Cleaning data** from irrelevant data, missing data, duplicated data and outliers
* **Data visualization** using seaborn plots
* **Exploratory Data Analysis** (Univariate and multivariate)
* **Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Systems**
  * User-user Similarity-based Collaborative Filtering
  * Item-item Similarity-based Collaborative Filtering
  * Matrix Factorization Collaborative Filtering
* **Model Evaluation** using k-fold validation using f1-score, precision and recall
* **Model Tuning** via GridSearchCV

## ðŸ““ Usage Guide
**For Recruiters**
1. Open up the .ipynb or .HTML file to understand into details what was done in the project.
2. Kindly contact me if you want to know more ðŸ˜ƒ

**For Learners**
1. Download the dataset and .ipynb file.
2. Open the .ipynb file using Google Colaboratory or jupyter notebook.
3. Read through the project context, objective, data description and dictionary.
4. Try and run the code in the .ipynb notebook, cell by cell. As the codes are well-commented, try to understand what each line of code does.
5. Use my code as a reference if you're stucked (My codes are trustworthy, they have been reviewed and I obtained a full score ðŸ¥‡)

**Thanks for reaching the end!**
